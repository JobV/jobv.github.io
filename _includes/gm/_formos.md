## Encounters

### 1. Smuggling operations

- Discover: easy perception check in alleyway from spaceport
- Description: See someone open a hatch on ground, three crates moved to nearby speeder

Ignore PCs unless interference. If asked about Bandin Dobah they say to check out Rii Jenks’ cantina.

### 2. Cheapest water seller on formos

- discover: look for cheap water (mention by GM)
- Description: human woman with big water jug on back, holding tray with jars of water and sign “Mam Nobah - cheapest water on formos

Is actually really cheap. Friendly, gossips. Was on Alderaan and left for a business trip to Corella when it got destroyed :”(

Son Jok Nobah tries to steal from NPC’s unless perception check vs. his cunning of 3 succeeds.

Son + Nobah
b1 a2 i1 c3 w1 p3 - rocks (d1, c-)

If PCs notice, free water; fault of the imperials.
