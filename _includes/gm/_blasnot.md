Blastech established a far-away spacestation in popular smuggling territory.

Here they could offload their failed experiments, ID-less weapons and other
dangerous items interesting for smugglers, thieves and scum.

The station being on the outer rim, it was hard to control, but the constant
influx of awesome goods was enough motivation for some to make sure this station
was kept safe.

Some years after the stations' founding, two executives at BlasTech,
Andrew Ashfield (CEO) and Kerloc N'Shive (Dir. Logistics) got into a fight.

Andrew blamed Kerloc for the impregnation of his sister, while Kerloc denied
on all accounts, even though baby Ashfield was born with little horns. Andrew
threw Kerloc out of the business.

Cleaning up his holodesk, Kerloc had a final stab. He destroyed all records
of weapon transports to space station and of the station itself, not before
he sent a final large shipment of the best BlasTech had to offer. He then
went along with this final transport and transformed the derelict space station
in a bar, nightclub, motel in space and named it BlasNOT.

BlasNOT is now a nice stop for smugglers. The docking bays are not large enough
to transport large goods, so only small items are traded and even that is kept
to a minimum here.

The main reason to go to BlasNOT is to have a nice anonymous stay, to enjoy
some drinks, drugs and some music and to find work.
Both small and big enterpreneuring folk with specific interests come here
to find people to carry out their special (dirty) work.

BlasNOT is kept alive by selling rooms, ships, weapons, drinks and information.
However, it's exceptionally discreet about its regular visitors, making it
even for the most wanted criminals an interesting spot to return.
