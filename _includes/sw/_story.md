# Introduction

On the planet of Onderon, a dangerous jungle planet with little
civilization, **Whisper Base** lies quiet and empty. Its previous
inhabitants dead and its conquerers missing.

Whisper base was in control by the Imperial Lieutenant Sarev,
and has been recently taken over by a team of Rebels led by commander
Arkhan. It was a first push in the Rebels' offensive to take back
Onderon from the Imperial Control by Moff Dardano.

The Rebel team has left an empty, damaged base behind.
A single droid is sweeping the halls of the base and the muffled noise
of captured Imperial soldiers is the only thing blocking out total silence.

On the verge of becoming a Rebel stronghold,
Whisper base is now in risk of being recaptured by the evil empire.
It is up to our heroes to prevent this from happening..

# Session 1: Making Friends

## Whisper Base

**Shar Dok**, often referring to himself as _The Shield_ arrives together with
**Tarr Nos-Shael** at Whisper Base, after being dropped with a shuttle from
[a rebel GR-75](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/GR-75_medium_transport).

The base is in a bad state. The Nilos, a shuttle that is stored at the landing
pad in the base, has one engine blown out. There is almost everything available
to repair it, but an essential _Flux Capacitor_. One of the anti-air turrets
is in a bad state and the Signal Intelligence (SigInt) array clearly needs some
maintenance.

Tarr Nos-Shael attempts to look at the data stored in **Toor**, the robot
that is cleaning the halls. On inspection, he finds a glitch in his software
and is able to remove the restraining bolt from the robot in a loud BANG.
Toor agrees to help the Rebels and starts working on fixing the anti-air turret.
