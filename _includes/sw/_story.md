# Introduction

On the planet of Onderon, a dangerous jungle planet with little
civilization, **Whisper Base** lies quiet and empty. Its previous
inhabitants dead and its conquerers missing.

Whisper base was in control by the Imperial Lieutenant Sarev,
and has been recently taken over by a team of Rebels led by commander
Arkhan. It was a first push in the Rebels' offensive to take back
Onderon from the Imperial Control by Moff Dardano.

The Rebel team has left an empty, damaged base behind.
A single droid is sweeping the halls of the base and the muffled noise
of captured Imperial soldiers is the only thing blocking out total silence.

On the verge of becoming a Rebel stronghold,
Whisper base is now in risk of being recaptured by the evil empire.
It is up to our heroes to prevent this from happening..

# Session 1: Making Friends

## Whisper Base

**Shar Dok**, often referring to himself as _The Shield_ arrives together with
**Tarr Nos-Shael** at Whisper Base, after being dropped with a shuttle from
[a rebel GR-75](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/GR-75_medium_transport).

The base is in a bad state. The Nilos, a shuttle that is stored at the landing
pad in the base, has one engine blown out. There is almost everything available
to repair it, but an essential _Flux Capacitor_. One of the anti-air turrets
is in a bad state and the Signal Intelligence (SigInt) array clearly needs some
maintenance.

Tarr Nos-Shael attempts to look at the data stored in **Toor**, the robot
that is cleaning the halls. On inspection, he finds a glitch in his software
and is able to remove the restraining bolt from the robot in a loud BANG.
Toor agrees to help the Rebels and starts working on fixing the anti-air turret.

Upon hearing a noise coming from the Armory, the Rebels open the Armory and
find four restrained Imperial Army soldiers. One falls in front of Tarr Nos and
Shar the moment they open the door and Shar does not hesitate to give him an
extra punch in the face. Two other imperials are shot in the head and a fourth is
interrogated about the base.

(what happened to the remaining two imperials?)

They get some information about a nearby village, Darrastead, whose inhabitants
were used to build Whisper base.

Tarr and Shar decide to fly to Darrastead on two speeders.

## Darrastead

On their way to Darrastead, Tarr Nos crashes his speeder and the team encounters a bewildered imperial
army trooper. The trooper is promptly killed by Shar with a shot of his blaster,
while he sits calmly on his speeder.

The team is brought to the elder of the shabby village.
The Imperial presence clearly has taken its toll on the villagers and
there is a noticeable lack of tech to be seen.

The village elder, a frail, yet sharp, old lady, needs some convincing
about their identities before asking for supplies for the village.

Tarr Nos and Shar agree to send two speeder bikes with supplies to the
village. In exchange, the village will send ten willing men and women to
Whisper base for maintenance and general help.

On their way out, Shar asks about any other help they might get from the jungle
and the village elder speaks about the **Beast Riders**. She doesn't give many
details, but gives them the location of one of their hunting grounds.

## Whisper Base

Back in the base, Shar Dok and Tarr Nos-Shael assign the villagers
to several posts and train a number of them.

## Beast Rider Initiation

- Shar and Tarr-Nos murder a bunker to get recognized as heroes by
the beast Riders

# Session 2: Shopping

After Shar disappears into the Jungle, Tarr-Nos is alone in Whisper Base.
An 'escape' pod drops down, with Zekk on board.

Zekk has three eyes and joins Tarr-Nos in the fight against the rebellion.

## Imperial Patrol

Not much later, an imperial patrol is spotted moving away from the base by Tiffany (Ti-FANY).
The heroes try to ambush the patrol, but Tarr-Nos ends the battle
unconcious. The last imperial is slain by a mysterious man with a sword.
Jaton Paxos joins the crew.

## Beast Rider Lodge

With the proof of imperial ownage, the three set out to the lodge
of the beast riders, where Tarr-Nos wins a golden-tipped spear
in a drinking game. A short-haired beast rider get knocked out by
Tarr-Nos' shock gloves.
The beast riders pledge their help.

## Iziz

The crew heads to Iziz for shopping and looking for intel.

Initially they try to upgrade Toor, which looks expensive.
They end up being able to upgrade his hands formidably, allowing
him to carry and use a blaster with some expertise.

Next they were off to Sunbucks for a nice space-coffee and some intel.
