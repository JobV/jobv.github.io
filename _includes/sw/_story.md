# Operation Shadowpoint

## Introduction

On the planet of Onderon, a dangerous jungle planet with little
civilization, **Whisper Base** lies quiet and empty. Its previous
inhabitants dead and its capturers missing.

Whisper base was in control by the Imperial Lieutenant Sarev,
and has been recently captured by a team of Rebels led by commander
Arkhan. A first push to remove the Imperial control, headed by the
dangerous Moff Dardano, from Onderon.

The Rebel team has left an empty, damaged base behind.
A single droid is sweeping the halls of the base and the muffled noise
of captured Imperial soldiers is the only thing blocking out total silence.

On the verge of becoming a Rebel stronghold,
Whisper base is now in risk of being recaptured by the evil empire.
It is up to Tarr Nos-Shael and Shar to prevent this from happening..
