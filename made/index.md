title: Things I made

## **Pushmeetup**

Pushmeetup was an iOS app I made together with [Marcelo Lebre].
It had only one goal: make it super easy and super fast to
share locations with a friend.

We used Facebook login to manage friends and build a
Rails application to track and share location.
It was especially interesting to work with Postgis, storing
location data in Postgres.

## **Domici.ly**

Domici.ly was a web application, built on Ruby on Rails,
for homeowner organizations to manage their buildings.

It allowed them to schedule meetings, coordinate on issues,
share documents with their homeowners and much more.

Domici.ly ran for about a year and had several hundred
users. We shut it down eventually because we were not having fun.

I built the application by myself, but we operated it under a
company I co-founded, JAXONS.

## **Kureer**

In 2012 I left my spot at Champalimaud's International
Doctoral Program and chance to work towards a PhD to found my
own startup.

I strongly believed (and still do) in doing something that
makes you happy, above everything else. I founded a startup
that tried to make this easier in a country where I didn't
speak the language (Portugal).

Together with a co-founder and two engineers,
we worked on a web app that made connecting employers and
job seekers easier.

I underestimated the time it would take to raise money,
and quickly ran out of our borrowed starting capital
(of less than 5k euro).

## **Actually**

During my time in neuroscience, I wanted to try my hand
at iOS development. Actually was the result.

Actually was a Todo app with a built-in pomodoro
timer. It worked reasonably well, but I wasn't interested
in maintaining it. I ended up doing a single big update,
after which I abandoned the project.
