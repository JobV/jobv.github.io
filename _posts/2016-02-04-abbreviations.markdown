There is no good reason to use abbreviations in (online) communication.
If you really insist on using abbreviations, use

automatically.

Using abbreviations makes it harder to understand what you're talking about.
Especially for people whose first language is not English, using abbreviations
can add a second layer of abstraction, possible confusion.

Not only international environments suffer from this bad habit.
Many abbreviations are ambiguous or unclear.

For medical patients unnecessary usage of abbreviations can be
[life threatening]:

> A prescription written for chlorambucil (Leukeran) with directions to give “one tablet BIW” led to a pharmacist typing “one tablet twice daily,” but the prescriber intended for the patient to take 1 tablet twice a week.

### Exceptions

If everyone that will ever read your text is absolutely expected and required
to know a specific abbreviation and therefore it is a commonly used
abbreviation, it is fair to use the abbreviation. NASA, GUI are fair examples.
In fact, I recommend against writing out NASA.

### How to stop using abbreviations

In an organisation, you can make the usage of abbreviations a policy everyone
has to follow. Elon Musk has [famously forbidden] the usage of useless acronyms
at Space X.
