DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.*

Whenever you collaborate on digital media,
make sure to link to all relevant things. Never assume
everyone knows where to find things.

This also prevents unnecessary duplication of media,
promoting working DRY.

If you're sharing a wall of text,
it's a good idea to link important bits on top
or on the bottom, rather than inline.

\* *Although I don't encourage the usage of Abbreviations,
DRY is a concept known among programmers and has a nice
ring to it. Programmers often say "Make sure your code is DRY"*
